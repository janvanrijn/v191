  Abstract'
section: Extended Abstracts
abstract: We summarise experiments evaluating cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL)
  with feature extractors trained on ImageNet. The work explores the transfer performance
  of extracted features on five target domains with different degrees of similarity
  to ImageNet. These experiments compare robust classifiers and normalisation methods,
  consider multi-instance learning algorithms, and evaluate the effect of using features
  extracted by different ResNet backbones at various levels of their convolutional
  hierarchies. The cosine similarity classifier and 1-vs-rest logistic regression
  with $\ell_2$ regularisation are the top-performing robust classifiers in the evaluation,
  and $\ell_2$ normalisation improves performance on all five target domains when
  using LDA as the robust classifier. The results also show that feature extractors
  with the highest capacity do not always achieve the best CDFSL performance. Lastly,
  simple multi-instance learning methods are shown to improve classifier accuracy.
