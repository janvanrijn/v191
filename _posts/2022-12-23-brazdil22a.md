title: 'Advances in Metalearning: ECML/PKDD Workshop on Meta-Knowledge Transfer'
section: Preface
abstract: 'Meta-knowledge plays an important role in current machine learning and
  AutoML systems. One way of acquiring meta-knowledge is by observing learning processes
  (on the same task, or on different tasks) and representing it in such a way that
  it can be used later to improve future learning processes. Metalearning systems,
  on the other hand, normally explore metaknowledge acquired on different problems.
  The systems may, in addition, use metaknowledge concerning which part of the space
  should be examined first (i.e., a warm start or dynamic scheduling). Various contributions
  of this workshop addressed various aspects of metaknowledge, and in particular,
  how it is exploited in different systems. This workshop included two invited talks,
  one by Hospedales on “Meta-learning for Knowledge Transfer” and another by Hitzler
  on “Some advances regarding ontologies and neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence”. '
