title: Some advances regarding ontologies and neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence
section: Contributed Talks
abstract: 'This abstract serves as pointers to the most relevant literature references
  underlying my workshop keynote. Symbolic AI (based on knowledge representation and
  formal logic) and AI based on artificial neural networks (such as deep learning)
  are fundamentally different approaches to artificial intelligence with complementary
  capabilities. The former are transparent and data-efficient, but they are sensitive
  to noise and cannot be applied to non-symbolic domains where the data is ambiguous.
  The latter can learn complex tasks from examples, are robust to noise, but are black
  boxes; require large amounts of – not necessarily easily obtained – data, and are
  slow to learn and prone to adversarial examples. Either paradigm excels at certain
  types of problems where the other paradigm performs poorly. In order to develop
  stronger AI systems, integrated neuro-symbolic systems that combine artificial neural
  networks and symbolic reasoning are being sought. In this talk, we discuss two related
  lines of investigation in neuro-symbolic AI. (1) We report on our work in progress
  of using concept induction over ontologies for explaining deep learning systems.
  (2) We present recent results regarding the acquisition of formal logical reasoning
  capabilities over ontologies, though deep learning, which we call Deep Deductive
  Reasoning. '
