title: 'On Usefulness of Outlier Elimination in Classification Tasks: Extended Abstract'
section: Extended Abstracts
abstract: 'Although outlier detection/elimination has been studied before, few comprehensive
  studies exist on when exactly this technique would be useful as preprocessing in
  classification tasks. Our objective is identify the most useful workflows for a
  given set of tasks (datasets), and then examine which outlier elimination methods
  (OEMs) appear in these workflows. The workflows considered in this work are pipelines
  that include an outlier elimination step followed by a classifier. The OEMs identified
  this way are considered as useful. Our final aim is to verify what effect this alteration
  has on generalization performance. '
