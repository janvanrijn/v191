title: Instance selection for configuration performance comparison
section: Original Papers
abstract: Comparing the performance of two configurations of a given algorithm plays
  a critical role in algorithm configuration and performance optimisation, be it automated
  or manual, and requires substantial computational resources. Time is often wasted
  on less promising configurations but also on instances that require a long running
  time regardless of the configuration. Prior work has shown that by running an algorithm
  on carefully selected instances, the time required to accurately decide the better
  of two given algorithms can be  significantly reduced. In this work, we explore
  ways to apply a similar selection process to compare two configurations of the same
  algorithm. We adapted four selection methods from the literature to work with the
  performance model used in model-based configurators and evaluated them on six benchmarks.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that, depending on the problem instances and their
  running time distribution, a decision can be reached 5 to 3000 times faster than
  with random sampling, the method used in current state-of-the-art configurators.
