title: Searching in the Forest for Local Bayesian Optimization
section: Original Papers
abstract: Because of its sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) has become
  a popular approach in dealing with expensive black-box optimization problems, such
  as hyperparameter optimization (HPO). Recent empirical experiments showed that the
  loss landscapes of HPO problems tend to be more benign than previously assumed,
  i.e. in the best case uni-modal and convex, such that a BO framework could be more
  efficient if it can focus on those promising local regions. In this paper, we propose
  BOinG, a two-stage approach that is tailored toward HPO problems. In the first stage,
  we build a scalable global surrogate model with a random forest to describe the
  overall landscape structure. Further, we choose a promising subregion via a bottom-up
  approach to the upper-level tree structure. In the second stage, a local model in
  this subregion is utilized to suggest the point to be evaluated next. Empirical
  experiments show that BOinG is able to exploit the structure of typical HPO problems
  and performs particularly well on various problems from synthetic functions and
  HPO.
