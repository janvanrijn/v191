title: 'NeurIPS’22 Cross-Domain MetaDL competition: Design and baseline results'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We present the design and baseline results for a new challenge in the ChaLearn
  meta-learning series, accepted at NeurIPS’22, focusing on “cross-domain” meta-learning.
  Meta-learning aims to leverage experience gained from previous tasks to solve new
  tasks efficiently (i.e., with better performance, little training data, and/or modest
  computational resources). While previous challenges in the series focused on within-domain
  few-shot learning problems, with the aim of learning efficiently N-way k-shot tasks
  (i.e., N class classification problems with k training examples), this competition
  challenges the participants to solve “any-way” and “any-shot” problems drawn from
  various domains (healthcare, ecology, biology, manufacturing, and others), chosen
  for their humanitarian and societal impact. To that end, we created Meta-Album,
  a meta-dataset of 40 image classification datasets from 10 domains, from which we
  carve out tasks with any number of “ways” (within the range 2-20) and any number
  of “shots” (within the range 1-20). The competition is with code submission, fully
  blind-tested on the CodaLab challenge platform. The code of the winners will be
  open-sourced, enabling the deployment of automated machine learning solutions for
  few-shot image classification across several domains.
