title: Faster Performance Estimation for NAS with Embedding Proximity Score
section: Original Papers
abstract: Neural Architecture Search methods generate large amounts of candidate architectures
  that need training to assess their performance and find an optimal architecture.
  To minimize the search time we use different performance estimation strategies.
  The effectiveness of such strategies varies in terms of accuracy and fit and query
  time. We propose Embedding proximity score (EmProx). EmProx builds a meta-model
  that maps candidate architectures to a continuous embedding space using an encoder-decoder
  framework. The performance of candidates is then estimated using weighted kNN based
  on the embedding vectors of architectures of which the performance is known. Performance
  estimations of this method are comparable to similar predictors in terms of accuracy
  while being nearly nine times faster to train compared to similar methods. Benchmarking
  against other performance estimation strategies currently used shows similar or
  better accuracy, while being five up to eighty times faster. Code is made publicly
